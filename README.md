# Overview

To ensure secure and compliant transmission of event data from your servers to Netcoreâ€™s platform, we support AES-256 encryption in transit. This document outlines supported encryption methods, recommended practices, and how to enable encrypted event ingestion via our APIs.

# Why AES-256?

AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys) is an industry-leading encryption method used for secure data exchange. It provides:

- Strong security: Highly resistant to brute-force attacks
- Wide adoption: Used by governments, financial institutions, and enterprises
- Performance: Optimized for modern systems and fast execution

# Supported Encryption Methods

Follow the below steps for encryoting the data and pushing to CE dashboard.

# Step 1

Generate a SECRET_KEY and SECRET_IV on your system and share the data with us. The KEY and IV will be configured in our backend post which you can continue with the payload encryption and sending the encrypted data to CE dashboard.

- Here is a [Python script](script/aes256_key_iv_generator_script.py) which can generate the SECRET_KEY and SECRET_IV.

- To run the script use the command

`python3 aes256_key_iv_generator_script.py`

Sharing a sample result of running the above command.

Now the generated key and iv can be used to encrypt the payload data.

# Step 2

- Here is a [Python script](script/aes256_data_encryption_script.py) which can be used to encrypt the payload data.

- Sharing the sample usage of the script to encrypt data.

`python3 aes256_data_encryption_script.py '[
    {
    
        "asset_id": "392234ga43t3q4t3026227c3453gqe5",
        
        "activity_name": "form_submitted",
        
        "timestamp": "2025-08-26T12:05:43Z",
        
        "identity": "9999911111",
        
        "activity_source": "web",
        
        "activity_params": {
        
            "user_name": "Mahesh",
            
            "reason": "test 123",
            
            "day" : "Tuesday"
            
        }
        
    }    
]'`

- The resultant of the above command will be encrypted data. Sample given below.

  `Encrypted String (Base64): 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`

- Additionally the shared Python script also tests for decrypting the data. So the resultant would also show the decrypted payload as well.
